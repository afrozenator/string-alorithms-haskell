String Algorithms in Haskell

An absolute Haskell newbie's attempt to write string searching algorithms
in Haskell.

I'm aware that lists may not be the most effecient way of doing slicing
and Arrays maybe better, but this is just a first attempt. I'll add more
comments, algorithms and improvements later on.

Thanks!
